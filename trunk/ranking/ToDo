Error Arco 2013:
---------------
- FF beamer does not scroll automatic

Talk with Johannes Altner about Log Dragomer:
--------------------------------------------
- show national team ranking in result-service (independent of caching)

Observations World Cup KitzbÃ¼hl 2013:
------------------------------------
- judges still forget to import results into ranking
--> automatic import it, when general result set to official
- cache expiration not always working:
  + latest result should have short time, 'til latest comp is official and imported
  + better would be that making general result official activly invalidates cache & cdn, so it become available immediatly 
  + general result on ifsc-climbing.org did NOT show final, thought it was official on ifsc.egroupware.net
--> activly invalidating caches&cdn would work a lot better
    (requires normalized url parameters or invalidating complete cat eg. "json.php?*cat=N*", if that's possible


Arco World Championship July 2011
---------------------------------
- "fall" and "false start" as additional status for each speed run
--> BestOf mode 2. false start --> "eliminated", even if there is a valid run
- display of speed result contains two times "fall"
- speed result shows update button, even if no rights to change result (eg. anonymous)
- speed pairing has no header and footer
- for startorder in final, rules require countback to worldranking
- beamer on speed general result does NOT include new rounds in speed final

Mid-term:
- periodic update of results incl. pairing (by using beamer widget with doubleclick to edit)

Done:
25.05.2013:
- bouldering: new "checked" checkbox, which disabled all updates on an athlete
- display last modified time and modifier in boulder result
older:
- measurement should NOT be available after result official
- FF you can not define handholds: 29.08.2012 working in FF, Chrome & IE incl. print
